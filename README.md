# browser-synth
# initial commit
A simple Javascript app that allows the user to play an 18 key synthesizer in a browser. In this project I applied usage of flexbox CSS concepts, and 
utilized switch statements to correlate keydown events to notes output as sound. Also involved practice utilizing arrow functions in a meaningul manner. 
I consider this a version one of the project, as I hope to improve functionality by adding features like a volume knob or slider, pads for drum sequencing, 
and controlling various oscillators using mouse wheel integration as examples.
